		<h2>O'Sensei</h2>
		<p>
			Aikido was developed by Moreihei Uyeshiba (O’Sensei) at the end of the 19th and beginning of
			the 20th century. He synthesized it from various martial arts he learned as a young man.
			Aikido is non-violent and defensive. It blends the highest level of human ethics with modern
			martial arts.
		</p>

		<h2>Akira Tohei</h2>
		<p>
			In 1972 one O’Sensei’s senior students, Akira Tohei (8th Dan),was dispatched to the United
			States to teach Aikido. Tohei Sensei was based in Chicago, IL where he organized the Midwest
			Aikido Federation. The lead instructor at Asheville Aikikai, Daniel Palmer (5th Dan), was a
			student of Tohei Sensei.
		</p>
		<h2>Dan Palmer</h2>
		<p>
			In 1983 Daniel Palmer founded Asheville Aikikai as a non-profit corporation. Asheville Aikikai
			practices Aikido in the tradition of Tohei Sensei.
		</p>

		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>
			We are dedicated to the development of Aikido Spirit. Aikido Spirit fosters the highest
			ethical standards. Aikido is entirely defensive and is to be utilized only with an unprovoked
			attack. It utilizes methods of redirecting an attacker’s energy, ultimately projecting or
			grounding it. When techniques are applied correctly no serious injury occurs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aikido Spirit relies on finding and maintaining one’s center, both on the physical and mental
			plane. Aikido utilizes ki, or inner energy, to focus and cultivate a sense of centeredness,
			and to energize techniques. Aikido practice strengthens balance, encourages cooperation, and
			promotes quiet in the mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aikido Spirit fosters respect for self and others, facilitates non-violent behavior, promotes
			peaceful solutions to confrontations, nurtures self-confidence, and aids in positive
			development.
